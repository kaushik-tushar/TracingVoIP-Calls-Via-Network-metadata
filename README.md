# TracingVoIP-Calls-Via-Network-metadata
VoIPTraceFD – VoIP Call Tracing and Monitoring Tool A comprehensive tool for tracing, monitoring, and analyzing VoIP calls in real-time. Detects suspicious activity, visualizes SIP &amp; RTP packets, provides live call logs, and maps call geolocation. Built using Python, Flask, and web-based dashboards for effective VoIP security monitoring.


# VoIPTraceFD – VoIP Call Tracing and Monitoring Tool

VoIPTraceFD is a Python-based web application designed to monitor, trace, and analyze VoIP calls in real-time. It captures SIP and RTP packets, identifies suspicious activity, and provides live dashboards with graphs and logs. Ideal for cybersecurity enthusiasts and VoIP security monitoring purposes.

## Features

- Real-time SIP & RTP packet tracing
- Live logs of active VoIP calls
- Geolocation mapping of IP addresses
- Detection of suspicious calls and patterns
- Interactive web-based dashboard with charts

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.13
- **Frameworks:** Flask (backend), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend)
- **Libraries:**
  - Scapy (packet capturing and analysis)
  - Chart.js (interactive charts)
  - Leaflet.js (geolocation mapping)
- **Database:** SQLite (for storing suspicious IPs and call logs)
- **Deployment:** Localhost / Cloud (Vercel or any preferred cloud hosting)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/VoIPTraceFD.git
    cd VoIPTraceFD/backend
    Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Run the application:
    python app.py
    Open your browser and navigate to:


http://127.0.0.1:5000

Test Dataset
  For testing the tool, sample PCAP files are provided in the test_dataset folder. These datasets contain:
  SIP packets for call setup and teardown
  RTP packets for voice data transmission
  Malicious/suspicious VoIP call scenarios for detection testing

Sample files:
  sample_sip.pcap
  sample_rtp.pcap
  suspicious_calls.pcap
  Note: You can also capture live VoIP traffic in a controlled lab environment for real-time testing.

For testing VoIPTraceFD
- Randomly generated SIP packets simulating call setup and teardown
- Random RTP packets representing voice data transmission
- Example suspicious calls for testing alert detection

Usage
  Navigate to the Dashboard to see live SIP & RTP packet graphs.
  Check Live Logs for active call details.
  Suspicious IPs and calls are highlighted in the Alerts section.
  Geolocation of call endpoints can be viewed on the Map.
